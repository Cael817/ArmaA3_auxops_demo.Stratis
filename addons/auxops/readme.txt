This collection of files is suppose to make the framework for the player actions i want (i put it together mmostly to learn something and if anyone wonder what auxops stands for its Auxiliary Operations, i know i suck at naming stuff), its primarily meant for use with A3Wasteland but my idea is that i could possibly use it in "any" mission.
and most of the functions and scrips are either derived from that mission or the addons other people made for it. Others are found throughout the ArmA community or from tutorialsites like Killzone Kids or Kylania.
The functions etc may or may not work for you without some kind of adaptation, ie. adding anti hack exceptions, editing BE filters etc.
call it from the main mission init with "if (hasInterface || isServer) then { [] execVM "addons\auxops\init.sqf"; };"

Licenses aside i ask that you to keep the credits in the files, crediting me is not as important as the others as i mostly went "Frankenstien" on their stuff.

Credits go to (in no particular order, if you feel you should be here(or in any of the separate files), contact me thru the forums).
